      <p>Hello! Most people know me as Carter Wu, though my legal name is Xiaoxu Wu. Currently, I am a
      rising sophomore studying Computer Science and Engineering at University of California, Los Angeles.
      </p>
      <p>I am a tech enthusiast and I love following new trends, devices, and gadgets. This has been a passion of mine for a long time, and ever
        since I built my first computer and began browsing the internet, I knew I would go into a computer related field
        (not surprising that I decided to major in CSE!).
      </p>
      <p>
      In my free time, I like to program, watch TV, work-out, play sports, and hang out with friends. At UCLA, we have yet to explore other languages besides
      C++, C, and assembly in very much detail, which is why I've taken it upon myself to learn others - such as python and SQL. Besides this,
      I also enjoy watching videos and shows on Youtube, Netflix, and HBO. To balance all this time in front of the computer, I also go
      to the gym regularly, play basketball and soccer, and partake in other activities with my friends.
