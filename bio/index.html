            <p><strong>Hello!</strong><br><br>I'm a sophomore studying Computer Science and Engineering at University of California, Los Angeles.
            </p>
            <p>As a tech enthusiast, I love following all the newest tech trends and news. This passion started when I built my first computer and began browsing the internet;
                by that time I had already began dreaming of going into a computer related field.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's what brought me to UCLA, where I've honed my skills in C++ and programming.
                Outside of pure academics, I strive to expand my knowledge into other areas such as web development and data science.
                To that end, I'm currently a Web Developer for Daily Bruin, and a Python Developer for UCLA Center for Health Policy Research.
                Besides programming, I like to watch TV, work-out, play sports, and hang out with friends.
